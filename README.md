## Introduction

<strong>String Wrangler</strong> is a lightweight but powerful <em>editor plugin</em> for the <strong>Godot Engine</strong> that helps you eliminate string-related bugs by turning plain <code>String</code> and <code>Array[String]</code> properties into <strong>dropdowns in the Inspector</strong>.

In many systems ‚Äî like ability tools, attribute components, registries, item databases, and gameplay logic ‚Äî it's common to reference dynamic data using string names. These strings are often stored in exported variables, dictionaries, or custom resources and accessed with lookup functions like <code>get_by_name("Speed")</code> or <code>data["Health"]</code>.

But plain strings are <strong>fragile</strong>. They‚Äôre easy to mistype, hard to refactor, and prone to silent failures.

### ‚úÖ String Wrangler solves this

Using <strong>variable prefixing</strong>, String Wrangler detects your string-based fields and replaces them with dropdowns populated from your own datasets ‚Äî such as:

- Registry resources  
- Arrays inside custom resources  
- Script-exposed functions or variables  

The result is a typo-free, self-documenting, editor-integrated selection tool for any string-referenced system.

## Use Cases

String Wrangler is ideal for systems that <strong>cannot</strong> use Enums due to dynamic data. While Enums work well for fixed constants, this plugin excels when your data is:

- Defined in resources, not code  
- Grows or changes during development  
- Lives in registries or configuration assets  
- Driven by content creators, not programmers  

### Common Uses

- Attributes (e.g., "Health", "Stamina")  
- Effects and modifiers  
- Inventory items and crafting parts  
- Gameplay tag references  
- Ability targeting or lookup systems  
- Dynamic dictionaries and tables

## Features

- ‚úÖ Dropdowns for String/Array[String] fields  
- üîÅ Supports duplicates if needed  
- üì¶ Handles raw arrays, script calls, or property bindings  
- üß† Editor-friendly: no runtime cost  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Prefix-based mapping with full UI panel for configuration  
- üß± Modular and non-intrusive ‚Äì use only where you need it

## How It Works

1. <strong>Add a variable to your script using a prefix</strong>, e.g.:

   <pre><code>@export var SWSamp_tags: Array[String] = []</code></pre>

2. <strong>Register the prefix</strong> in the built-in <em>String Wrangler Prefix Editor</em>, including:
   <ul>
	 <li>A label (e.g., "Sample Tags")</li>
	 <li>A dataset (via raw list, script function, or variable)</li>
	 <li>Whether duplicates are allowed</li>
	 <li>Whether a ‚ÄúNone‚Äù option is shown</li>
   </ul>

3. The plugin automatically replaces any matching <code>String</code> or <code>Array[String]</code> field with a dropdown using your configuration.

No more mistyped names. No more manual typing. Just click and go.

## UI & Editor Integration

String Wrangler includes a dedicated <strong>Prefix Configuration Panel</strong> accessible from the Godot Editor. From here, you can:

- Add, edit, or remove prefix handlers  
- Connect a prefix to a dataset (resource, function, or variable)  
- Configure duplicate behavior and display options  
- Instantly see changes reflected in your Inspector

## Requirements

- Godot 4.4+ tested in 4.5.beta3
- Works with all projects and platforms
- Purely editor-side ‚Äî no runtime performance impact
